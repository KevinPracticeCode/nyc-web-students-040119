# React: Start to Finish

## Thinking in React

1. (Think) Break the UI into a component hierarchy
2. (Do) Build a static version of the app
3. (Think) Identify the minimum for your state + where
4. (Do) Implement state
5. (Think + Do) Add inverse data flow

## What's been nice?

* The first project was otter themed

## What's been hard?

* Passing a callback down more than one level
  * Knowing how to fire a callback prop to affect parent?
  * What info do we send? How do we know?
* Knowing when something should be refactored into a component?
  * What makes a component?
  * When to define one?
  * How small is too small?
* Which files to import into which components?
* How and where to define state in the application?
* When rendering, which level do we render at?
* Do we do DOM manipulation? (Not really.)
